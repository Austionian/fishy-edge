aca1f69c-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Herring,Okewis,herring.webp,,,woodlandherring.webp,"Herring are forage fish in the wild, mostly belonging to the family Clupeidae, but they are also an important food for humans. Herring often move in large schools around fishing banks and near the coast. The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off the west coast of South America. Three species of Clupea are recognized; the main taxon, the Atlantic herring, accounts for over half the worlds commercial capture of herrings.

Herrings played a pivotal role in the history of marine fisheries in Europe, and early in the twentieth century, their study was fundamental to the evolution of fisheries science. These oily fish also have a long history as an important food fish, and are often salted, smoked, or pickled."
aca2042a-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Salmon (farmed),,salmon.webp,,,,"Salmon populations have been established in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted by the state of Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide much in the way of a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery."
aca1f1e2-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Bass,Ashigan,bass.webp,,,woodlandbass.webp,"Largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass are the most popular game fish in North America. It is also very popular in South Africa. In the country, largemouth bass is often found in lakes, rivers, creeks, and dams. When fishing, lures (Bass worms) or live bait will work. Lures that mimic baitfish, worms, crayfish, frogs, and mice are all effective."
aca1f4a8-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Burbot/Loche,Mize,burbot.webp,,,woodlandburbot.webp,"Burbot live in large, cold rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, primarily preferring freshwater habitats, but able to thrive in brackish environments for spawning. During the summer, they are typically found in the colder water below the thermocline. In Lake Superior, burbot can live at depths below 300 m (980 ft). As benthic fish, they tolerate an array of substrate types, including mud, sand, rubble, boulder, silt, and gravel, for feeding."
aca200ec-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Whitefish,Atikamig,whitefish.webp,,,woodlandwhitefish.webp,"The lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is a species of freshwater whitefish from North America. Lake whitefish are found throughout much of Canada and parts of the northern United States, including all of the Great Lakes. The lake whitefish is sometimes referred to as a ""humpback"" fish due to the small size of the head in relation to the length of the body. It is a valuable commercial fish, and also occasionally taken by sport fishermen."
aca1f93a-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Perch,Azaawe,perch.webp,,,woodlandperch.webp,"Perch are a popular sport fish species. They are known to put up a fight, and to be good for eating. They can be caught with a variety of methods, including float fishing, lure fishing, and legering. Fly fishing for perch using patterns that imitate small fry or invertebrates can be successful."
aca1f5a2-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Cod,,cod.webp,,,,"Cod as food is popular in several countries. It has a mild flavour and a dense, flaky, white flesh. Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil, a common source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)."
aca1fa3e-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Northern Pike,Gnoozhe,pike.webp,,,woodlandpike.webp,"Northern pike are most often olive green, shading from yellow to white along the belly. The flank is marked with short, light bar-like spots and a few to many dark spots on the fins. Sometimes, the fins are reddish. Younger pike have yellow stripes along a green body; later, the stripes divide into light spots and the body turns from green to olive green. The lower half of the gill cover lacks scales, and it has large sensory pores on its head and on the underside of its lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw."
aca1fc82-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Sucker,Namebini,sucker.webp,,,woodlandsucker.webp,"They can be taken by many fishing methods, including angling and gigging. Often, species such as Catostomus commersonii and Hypentelium nigricans are preferred for eating. They can be canned, smoked, or fried, but small incisions often must be made in the flesh (termed ""scoring"") before frying to allow small internal bones to be palatable."
aca1fe4e-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Lake Trout,Namegos,trout.webp,,,woodlandtrout.webp,"Lake trout inhabit cold, oxygen-rich waters. They are pelagic during the period of summer stratification in dimictic lakes, often living at depths of 20–60 m (66–197 ft).

The lake trout is a slow-growing fish, typical of oligotrophic waters. It is also very late to mature. Populations are extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many native lake trout populations have been severely damaged through the combined effects of hatchery stocking (planting) and over harvest. Another threat to lake trout is acidification, which can have longterm effects on their populations through both direct harm and reduced prey populations (e.g. Mysis relicta)."
aca201c8-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Walleye,Ogaa,walleye.webp,,,woodlandwalleye.webp,"Because walleyes are popular with anglers, fishing for walleyes is regulated by most natural resource agencies. Management may include the use of quotas and length limits to ensure that populations are not overexploited. For example, in Michigan, walleyes shorter than 15 in (38 cm) may not be legally kept.

Since walleyes have excellent visual acuity under low illumination levels, they tend to feed more extensively at dawn and dusk, on cloudy or overcast days, and under choppy conditions when light penetration into the water column is disrupted. Although anglers interpret this as light avoidance, it is merely an expression of the walleyes competitive advantage over their prey under those conditions. Similarly, in darkly stained or turbid waters, walleyes tend to feed throughout the day. In the spring and fall, walleyes are located near the shallower areas due to the spawning grounds, and they are most often located in shallower areas during higher winds due to the murkier, higher oxygenated water at around six feet deep. On calm spring days, walleyes are more often located at the deep side of the shoreline drop-off and around shore slopes around or deeper than 10 feet."
aca1fb2e-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Smelt,,smelt.webp,,,,"Smelts are an important winter catch in the saltwater mouths of rivers in New England and the Maritime Provinces of Canada. Fishermen would historically go to customary locations over the ice using horses and sleighs. Smelt taken out of the cold saltwater were preferred to those taken in warm water. The fish did not command a high price on the market, but provided a source of supplemental income due to their abundance. The smelts were ""flash frozen"" simply by leaving them on the ice and then sold to fish buyers who came down the rivers.

In the present day, smelts are fished both commercially using nets at sea, and for recreation by hand-netting them or spearing or angling them through holes in river ice. They are often the target fish of small ""fishing shack"" villages that spring up along frozen rivers. Typical ways of preparing them to include pan-frying in flour and butter, or deep-frying in batter, and they are sometimes cooked directly out of the water over small stoves in the shacks."
aca20344-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Tilapia,,tilapia.webp,,,,"Tilapia typically have laterally compressed, deep bodies. Like other cichlids, their lower pharyngeal bones are fused into a single tooth-bearing structure. A complex set of muscles allows the upper and lower pharyngeal bones to be used as a second set of jaws for processing food (cf. morays), allowing a division of labor between the ""true jaws"" (mandibles) and the ""pharyngeal jaws."" This means they are efficient feeders that can capture and process a wide variety of food items. Their mouths are protrusible, usually bordered with wide and often swollen lips. The jaws have conical teeth. Typically, tilapia have a long dorsal fin, and a lateral line that often breaks towards the end of the dorsal fin, and starts again two or three rows of scales below."
aca1ffe8-cffa-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002,Tuna (canned),,tuna.webp,,,,"The tuna is a sleek and streamlined fish, adapted for speed. It has two closely spaced but separated dorsal fins on its back; The first fin is ""depressible"" – it can be laid down, flush, in a groove that runs along its back; it is supported by spines. Seven to 10 yellow finlets run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate – curved like a crescent moon – and tapered to pointy tips. A tuna pelvic fins are located below the base of the pectoral fins. Both dorsal and pelvic fins retract when the fish is swimming fast.

The tuna body is countershaded to camouflage itself in deeper water when seen from above, its dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue while the ventral or under side is silvery or whitish. The caudal peduncle, to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal keels on each side."
